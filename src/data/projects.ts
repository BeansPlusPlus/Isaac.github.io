    Reflection:
      'RED PING, is a work in progress! It is unfinished and we are working on it. This is not a Dev Academy project, but a project with software engineers I have met out in the wild world of Wellington. It was inspired by having many connections that need a way to communicate urgent emotional or physical crisis, or at-least warn or green-light a situations so others know whether to worry or not worry. Whilst we are still striving for an MVP(minimal viable product) eventually I would love to be able to include a little GPT chat bot that can respond with helpful tools or conversation when noone else is available, I would make the colours and buttons customizable as I LOVE customization and peoples ability to make things their own. I would also allow people to share joy and wellbeing PINGS not just less well PINGS, with the purpose of spreading hope as-well as taking care. ',
