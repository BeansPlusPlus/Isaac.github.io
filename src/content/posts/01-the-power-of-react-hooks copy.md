## Code that helps.


With the concept behind RED PING being a tool to allow those vulnerable to reach out when in crisis and also well before that, and JitterBug targeting loneliness especially in those more isolated due to a variety of reasons, I find myself naturally drawn towards creating technology tools that can improve wellbeing. 

## Why else do we build and build...
## If not toward a better home for ourselves and for others? 

I fully believe that sometimes promoting wellbeing is not always about medicine, help, or even acknowledging the hurt, but also about enabling creativity, connection, play, and simply joy in whatever form that might take. 
Building tools that can help others take on their own creative power, inspire learning and purpose, or just make someone laugh is to me just as important in terms of helping others as medicine and lifelines. 

Ideally we may have the tools to find joy and safety before emergency bells ever need be rung."
